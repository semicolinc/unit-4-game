The objective of this game is to defeat all of the enemy pokemon using strategy and knowledge of Pokemon type effectiveness. You will first start by choosing one of 4 starters: Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Pikachu. The remaining pokemon become your enemies on the way of becoming the champion. Click attack to start fighting against the enemy Pokemon. Be wary of the order in which you choose, because the last Pokemon is superpowered and will become a tough match! Your Pokemon grows in power after each attack. Have fun, trainer!
